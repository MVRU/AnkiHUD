**AnkiHUD** is a visual enhancement suite designed to modernize the Anki user experience (UX). While Anki is the gold standard for spaced repetition, its default interface can feel utilitarian and text-heavy.

AnkiHUD bridges the gap between data and design, overlaying a "Heads-Up Display" that makes your progress tangible, instant, and satisfying. It’s not just about numbers; it’s about **visualizing your mastery**.

## ✨ Features

### 💠 Visual Progress Tracking
Replace cold statistics with dynamic, color-coded visual indicators. Instantly understand your mastery over a subject without parsing tables of numbers.
* **Smart recursive calculation:** Automatically aggregates progress from sub-decks to parent decks.

* **Seamless integration:** Injects elements directly into the deck browser, respecting Anki's native layout.

### 🎨 Enhanced UX & Design
* **Native Look & Feel:** Fully responsive design that adapts perfectly to Anki’s **Light** and **Dark** modes.
* **Decluttered Interface:** Optional controls to hide native columns ("New", "Learn", "Due") for a cleaner, focused view.
* **Clean Typography:** Modernizes table spacing and font rendering for better readability.

### ⚙️ Granular Control
* **Global HUD Toggle:** Turn the entire visual system on or off with a single switch.
* **Per-Deck Customization:** Enable or disable visual elements for specific decks via the gear menu.
